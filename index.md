# Otter docs

[Otter](https://brunozhon.github.io/otter/) is an area where the otter stuff goes. No, I don't mean the otter stuff are there, **I mean that the other stuff live there.**

Otter docs are powered by Markdown files. Just [edit](https://github.com/Brunozhon/otter-docs/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to change a bug.
